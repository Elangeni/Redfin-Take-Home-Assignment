Redfin Take Home Coding Challenge by Elangeni Yabba

# Overview 
The goal of this is to write a simple command-line program that will print out a list of food trucks, given a source of food truck data from the San Francisco government’s API. Along with your code, readme, and installation instructions, we will also ask you to provide a brief write up discussing your thought process. 
The Task 
# Data 
The San Francisco government’s website has a public data source of food trucks (https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Schedule/jjew-r69b). The data can be accessed in a number of forms, including JSON, CSV, and XML. How you access the data is up to you, but you can find some useful information about making an API request to this data source here (https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.sfgov.org/jjew-r69b). 
# The Problem 
Write a command line program that prints out a list of food trucks that are open at the current date and current time, when the program is being run. So if I run the program at noon on a Friday, I should see a list of all the food trucks that are open then. 

#How to run this program

 Markup : - Bullet list
              - Nested bullet
                  - Sub-nested bullet etc
          - Bullet list item 2
