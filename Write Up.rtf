\f0\fs24 \cf0 When completing this project, I broke it down into three more minor problems: getting the current time, performing the GET request, and displaying the result. I chose to keep the logic for obtaining the date and time in a separate script. I made this choice so that future modifications would be easier to handle. For example, passing the time or getting the time from the user could be addressed here. I decided to use HTTPS instead of request to perform the GET request. I was initially using request but ran into some issues. I wanted to complete this in two hours, so I switched to HTTPS, which I am more familiar with. Lastly, I then printed the results to the console and awaited the user's decision about whether or not to proceed. As long as there are more records to print, the program will continue to run until the user exits. The program will end once there are no more records.}
